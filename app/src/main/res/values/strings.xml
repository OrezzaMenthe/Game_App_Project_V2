    <string name="textHouseplant">Peperomia is a large genus of tropical plants in the family Piperaceae that are native to Mexico South America and the Caribbean. With more than 1 500 known species these hearty plants boast thick fleshy leaves that contribute to their drought tolerance and vigor. \n\nPlants in the Peperomia genus can look so different from one to the next that it is difficult to discern if they are even related. For example varieties like the Peperomia obtusifolia are commonly confused with rubber plants due to their similar appearance. </string>
